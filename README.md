# Scientific Research

This repository will store some stuff about my scientific research.

Some codes and notes will not have a previous context.

## Thematic

The main thematic is Geometric Optimization.

My notes could be found [here](https://energetic-blinker-147.notion.site/IC-5f13b1deac5f4073808ff39dc48a2302)

## Benchmark

Just a simples bech with newtons_method 2 write in `python` and `golang`

```bash
# Python
time python3 ./newtons-method-2.py 
Converge in (0.6234994049308765, 0.02803775852868567)

real 0m0,024s
user 0m0,024s
sys  0m0,000s
```

```bash
# Golang
time ./newtons-method-2 
Converge in [0.6234994049308766 0.028037758528685664]
